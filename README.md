This is a launcher specifically made for the 2026 Game Jam organized by 42 Luxembourg. Please note that, although you can
build this project, it is not meant to be used as a standalone application.

The style is inspired by **Zenless Zone Zero**, a popular anime game.

## Features

### Launcher

- Launches games that are defined in a list. The games must be present on the system and **pre-compiled**.
- Configuration must be done before building the project, due to command permissions.

### Voting

- Allows users to vote for their favorite games.
- Players can assign **1–5 stars** to each game.
- Star ratings will additionally be displayed as a score, ranging from **D** to **S**.
- Votes are stored in `votes.jsonl` inside the app data directory.
